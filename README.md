# Deep-Learning-Terrain-Navigation
This work investigates a strategy for evaluating the navigability of terrain from 3-D imaging. Labeled training data was automatically generated by running a simulation of a mobile robot naively exploring a virtual world.  During this exploration, sections of terrain were perceived through simulated depth imaging and saved with labels of safe or unsafe, depending on the outcome of the robot's experience driving through the perceived regions.  This labeled data was used to train a deep convolutional neural network. Once trained, the network was able to evaluate the safety of perceived regions.  The trained network was shown to be effective in achieving relatively safe, autonomous driving through novel, challenging, unmapped terrain.
